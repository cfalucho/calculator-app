# Calculator Web App

------------------------------
## Technologies
- HTML/CSS
- JavaScript




## Goal

The goal was to build a calculator web application to learn JavaScript programming because it is the language of the web. JavaScript allows
websites to become more interactive adding all kinds of functionality and Web APIs. 


## What I learned?

While building this project, It was fun to learn HTML DOM and how JavaScript is able to access and change HTML. Being able to use
the event listener method on a variable and creating a function that would execute a command made it useful to change HTML contents.

A great way to modify the content of an HTML element is by using the `innerHTML property.` By using the HTML DOM you can access
any element in an HTML page. The following syntax is an example of how you can access HTML elements.
(i.e. `document.getElementById("input")` )
