# Calculator Web App

------------------------------
## Technologies
- HTML/CSS
- JavaScript




## Goal

The goal was to build a calculator web application to learn JavaScript programming because it is the language of the web. JavaScript allows
websites to become more interactive adding all kinds of functionality and Web APIs. 


## What I learned?

While building this project, It was fun to learn HTML DOM and how JavaScript is able to access and change HTML. 

I was basically able to select any element inside the DOM. Once I had an element selected, I stored it in a variable and from there be able to manipulate it however I want using properties or methods available.  


## What I struggled with?

Biggest issue was finding great examples of how to properly acess HTML DOM. I searched through stack overflow and though the community was great at explaining HTML DOM, I needed more of a basic level understanding how it worked. Resources such as [W3Schools](https://www.w3schools.com/js/js_htmldom_document.asp) and [MDN Web Docs](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Document_Object_Model/Introduction) truly helped with introducing basic representation of the DOM and even showed great examples.



## How can I improve?

One way for me to improve is to fuilly understand the syntax and read the documentations over and over again. In addition, make edits and read different kind of APIs to further my knowledge when using the DOM. By increasing my knowledge of the fundamentals of the DOM, and how it works, can best improve my skills in JavaScript.
