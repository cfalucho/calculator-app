# Calculator Web App

------------------------------
## Technologies
- HTML/CSS
- JavaScript




## Goal

The goal was to build a calculator web application to learn JavaScript programming because it is the language of the web. JavaScript allows
websites to become more interactive adding all kinds of functionality and Web APIs. 


## What I learned?

While building this project, It was fun to learn HTML DOM and how JavaScript is able to access and change HTML. 

I was basically able to select any element inside the DOM. Once I had an element selected, I stored it in a variable and from there be able to manipulate it however I want using properties or methods available.  


## What I struggled with?

Biggest issue was finding great examples of how to properly acess HTML DOM. I searched through stack overflow and though the community was great at explaining HTML DOM, I needed more of a basic level understanding how it worked. Resources such as [W3Schools](https://www.w3schools.com/js/js_htmldom_document.asp) and [MDN Web Docs](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Document_Object_Model/Introduction) truly helped with introducing basic representation of the DOM and even showed great examples.



## How can I improve?

One way for me to improve is to fully understand the syntax and to start writing code. Reading documentation and understanding the basic fundamentals are a great way to learn, but it also means that you have to put it into practice. By continuously writing code and making mistakes, I was able to get a better understanding of what I was doing wrong. 

I need to write more pseudo code to better understand what code needs to be mapped out.
